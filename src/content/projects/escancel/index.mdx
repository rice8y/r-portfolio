**escancel** is a simple and convenient CLI tool to cancel your SLURM jobs — essentially an *easy scancel*.  
It lists your active jobs and lets you interactively select which ones to cancel, making `scancel` faster and more user-friendly.

## Installation

You can install this CLI tool using `uv` in two different ways:

### A. Install directly from GitHub (recommended)

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/rice8y/escancel.git
```

This will fetch and install the latest version directly from the repository.

### B. Install from a local clone

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rice8y/escancel.git
```

2. Move into the project directory:

```bash
cd escancel
```

3. Install the package in editable mode using uv tool:

```bash
uv tool install -e .
```

This is useful if you plan to modify the code locally.

## Upgrade

To upgrade escancel to the latest version:

```bash
uv tool upgrade escancel
```

This will fetch the latest version from the original source and update your installation.
